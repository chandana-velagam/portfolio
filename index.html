        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      </DIV>
      <p style="text-align : justify">Being an ICSE student with java as the core topic in the computer subject, I’ve written my first piece of code when I was in grade 8. Ever since I’ve been obsessed with the idea of solving problems using software
        systems. Back at school, I loved Physics and Mathematics but deep inside, I knew that I’ve always been a little biased towards Computer Science. ;)
        I’ve been a well-known student in computer labs at my college. I can code in C, C++, Python, and Java. I also learned Unix Systems Programming out of curiosity to automate a coding challenge at college.

        While I was a sophomore, I’ve volunteered at Make a Difference, Guntur, an NGO which primarily works for teaching kids at shelter home and equips them with necessary life skills. I’m fortunate enough for contributing as an Ed Support
        volunteer who taught maths to few kids. This experience has moulded me into a better person and gave a new perspective to life.

        My first industrial exposure happened with ISRO when I was selected for an internship with them for a period of one month. During this time, I got an opportunity to work on one of their live projects!
        Adding to that, getting to see their scientists work in real and being having access to many internal facilities at ISRO was a life time experience for me! This has boosted my confidence like never before.

        I’ve later joined EPAM Systems, Hyderabad for an internship of 6 months and have contributed to my best ability as an automation tester. I now know how a tester thinks and works because of which I am able to code bug-free solutions most of
        the time.

        Apart from my keen interest for engineering, I love to indulge in discussions with people related to cooking and traveling. I love to find joy in small things of my life. .</p>
